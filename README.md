I am Miguel new to this being a developer i mean.  I have fooled around with other programing tools in the past but this is a completely different experience.  I am amazed on how fast it has evolved since i last gave this a try a few years back.  After focusing solely in networking and computer repair, I find my self back where i started when i was still going to college for my BA yes some years ago. but a new opportunity has showed itself where i can take my fasination for computers to other levels.  I am ready to give this all that i've got and more.  I want to go further push my limits to places i didn't even know i could go, where i will venture far beyong from my conforts and try new tools such as this.  I will give it my all to grasp this opportunity, it will be done.
